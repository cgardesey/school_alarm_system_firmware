## Features

-  **Display mode**: Available display modes are: time, date, stopwatch, countdown
-  **Remote controll**: Set time, date, countdown, stopwatch with remote control.
-  **Automatic mode**: Auto adjust display brightness in **automatic mode**
-  **Manual mode**: Manually adjust display brightness with remote control in **manual mode**
-  **Time format**: Choose between **12-hour** and **24-hour** time display modes

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following components:
- Two Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano)
  The two boards will communicate serially. One board will serve as the master and the other will serve as the slave
- RTC
- 20x4 LED
- 4x4 Keypad
- Sim800 or sim900
- PIR's
- 120db buzzers
- Switch (Toggle, push button or slide switch)
- Terminal blocks (optional)
- 12V 5A power adapter (with stable output)
- Flexible wire calbe
- Packaging (Junction box, 3D moulded plastic box, wooden box etc)
- Resistors
- Transistors
- Capacitors
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)

## Hardware Setup
Setup the the hardware as shown below:

## Software Setup
1. Install the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) from the [official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and select the appropriate board and port from the **Tools** menu.
4. Create a new sketch in the Arduino IDE.
5. Copy and paste the code from the `Smart_Security.ino` file into your sketch.
6. Save the sketch with a meaningful name.

## Usage
1. Upload the **clock_firmware.ino** sketch to the Arduino board by clicking the **Upload** button in the Arduino IDE.
2. The LED connected to the Arduino board should start blinking at a fixed interval.
3. Experiment with the code to and customize to suit your needs.
